``Device42 API
``
---
* Works great with ServiceNow
* Created an API to pull all data

`What for?
`
* D42 does not allow ServiceNow to add more than one device at this time
* The purpose of the API is to pull the data to a csv and map it to ServiceNow to populate the data instantly
* Working on new features to improve internal workflow on Device42
